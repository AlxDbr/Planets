# Planets
We have discovered a lot of exoplanets, but it is difficult to estimate whether a discovered planet is telluric like Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, is a gas giant like Jupiter and Saturn, or is an icy giant like Uranus and Neptune. The goal of this project will be to create clusters for all these exoplanets to determine all their natures
